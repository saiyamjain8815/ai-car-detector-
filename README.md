This project implements an AI-driven car simulation, where the AI learns to navigate through various maps using the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm.
The simulation allows the AI to evolve over multiple generations, improving its driving skills and avoiding obstacles. 
The project is built using Python and utilizes libraries like pygame for graphical rendering and neat for evolutionary neural networks. 
The car is trained to navigate maps by avoiding collisions, with the ability to load different map images for varied training environments.

Key Skills:
Python Programming: The project is developed in Python, involving object-oriented programming principles.
AI & Machine Learning: Utilizes NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) for evolving neural networks to control the car.
Pygame: Used for rendering the simulation, managing car movement, map loading, and collision detection.
Algorithm Optimization: The code has been optimized to efficiently train the AI across generations.
Neuroevolution: Applying evolutionary strategies to improve neural network performance over time.
Simulation Design: Building and running simulations for AI-based learning in a graphical environment.
